- No need to import React any more in the component files. From React 17 on words we dont need
to import the React. Because the compilers like babel or typescript take care of compiling the
jsx/tsx code into js/ts. Babel has respective plugins that are added as part of preset
    - basically no more React.createElement
- Improved bundle size: Potential reduction in bundle size due to optimized input
- Foundation for futute optimizations: Enables React for further performance enhancements
- React 19 builds upon this foundation with other enhancements
